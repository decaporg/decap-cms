# Docs coming soon!

Decap CMS was converted from a single npm package to a "monorepo" of over 20 packages.
We haven't created a README for this package yet, but you can:

1. Check out the [main readme](https://github.com/decaporg/decap-cms/#readme) or the [documentation
   site](https://www.decapcms.org) for more info.
2. Reach out to the [community chat](https://decapcms.org/chat/) if you need help.
3. Help out and [write the readme yourself](https://github.com/decaporg/decap-cms/edit/master/packages/decap-cms-widget-markdown/README.md)!
