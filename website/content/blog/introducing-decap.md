We are proud to introduce Decap CMS, the [rebranded version of Netlify CMS](https://www.netlify.com/blog/netlify-cms-to-become-decap-cms/). We took this step because we didn't like that this awesome project was slowly dying, and we wanted to ensure that it would continue to be supported and improved.

We love Netlify CMS for multiple reasons. Its ease of configuration and how simple it is for editors to use. Additionally it ships with lots of features and is highly customisable. It is also an integral part of the great Jamstack and open source community.

As the new maintainers of Decap CMS, our plan is to continue on the premise of a simple, easy-to-use, open source, git-based CMS. We are excited about the potential for this type of product and we strive that it remains a viable option for developers and editors alike.

First we plan to solve deprecation issues, then we will evaluate what are the next chapters for Decap. In the mean time, we will appreciate any contributions in form of pull requests, issues and discussions on GitHub.

We understand that there may be some growing pains as we transition to being the maintainers of this project, but please bear with us as we try to bring this project from the dead. We are excited to continue developing and improving Decap CMS with your help!

We would like to thank Netlify for entrusting us with the Netlify CMS project. We are excited and grateful for this opportunity.
