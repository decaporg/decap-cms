You can adapt Decap CMS to a wide variety of projects. It works with any content written in markdown, JSON, YAML, or TOML files, stored in a repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org). You can also create your own custom backend.

This tutorial guides you through the steps for adding Decap CMS to a site that's built with a common [static site generator](https://www.staticgen.com/), like Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo, or Gatsby. Alternatively, you can [start from a template](../start-with-a-template) or dive right into [configuration options](../configuration-options).
